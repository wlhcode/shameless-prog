# Shameless (self-claimed) useful program
A shameless self-claimed useful program created in 10 minutes when I had time to spare in ??? programming competition.
Of course, this is only a remake of what was created that day.
Be sure to check this out when you are bored.

## Modes
### Sandbox
The sandbox offers a playground for you to type random things in. It may be useful to serve as a one-time notepad.
The sandbox has both the clear screen and the return to menu command.

### Notepad
The notepad is a variaion of the sandobx. It creates a text file `gen_text.txt` in the directory your program is in.
Beware though, it may overwrite the files with the same name.
The return to menu function is provided.

### Simple Calculator
It acts like any normal calculator. Enter a valid mathematical phrase and it will calculate the answer for you.
~~Except it might be dumb and stupid and broken and keep returning out of range errors.~~

### BMI Calculator
The BMI calculator is a bit special. It only requires your name, instead of your height and weight. 
Nevertheless, it is tested and will always be accurate.

### Storage Killer
There are way too many "storage savers" in the app store and on the Internet, but we haven't got a __storage killer__!
The Storage Killer kills your storage by generating a huge file automatically filled with `Hello World!`.
It will also keep track on how much storage (in 100 MiB) you have killed so far.

### Flickering Mode
Enter the EOF (CTRL+Z) character and the screen will flicker continuously. Tested thoroughly and it works every time.
